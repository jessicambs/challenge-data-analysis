# Data Analysis

- Repository: `challenge-data-analysis`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `2 days`
- Deadline: `17/05/2021 13:30`
- Team challenge : 3

## Mission objectives

- Be able to use `pandas`.
- Be able to use Data visualisation libraries.(`matplotlib` or `seaborn`)
- Be able to clean a dataset for analysis
- Be able to establish conclusions about a dataset.
- Be able to find and answer creative questions about data
- Be able to think outside the box

## The Mission

The real estate company "ImmoEliza" wants to establish itself as the biggest one in all of Belglium. To pursue this goal, it needs to create a machine learning model to predict prices on Belgium's sales. That way, they can pick out the properties that are the most valuable to them.

But for this, it needs to do a preliminary analysis to gather some information. Having no in-house data scientist, they are looking for talented people to do it for them.

Since your last encounter with them went great, they reached out to you to do this job. Everything is in your hands now!

Take the dataset previously scraped to do the analysis. *(If you were in different groups, decide together which dataset you are going to use.)*

### Must-have features

##### Step 1 : Data Cleaning

You have collected your data! So it's time to do a cleaning on it. A cleaned dataset is a dataset that doesn't contain any duplicates, is blank spaces or error-free. The rest of the analysis can be discarded if you neglect this step!

- No duplicates
- No blank spaces (ex: ``" I love python  "`` =>  ``"I love python"``)
- No errors
- No empty values

##### Step 2 : Data Analysis

Now that the data has been collected and cleaned, it is time for the analysis. What is the target variable? How many variables and inputs do you have? And so on...

Use the tools such as `matplotlib`/`seaborn` !

You must be able to answer :

- Which variable is the target ?
- How many rows and columns ?
- What is the correlation between the variables and the target ? (Why might that be?)
- What is the correlation between the variables and the other variables ? (Why?)
- Which variables have the greatest influence on the target ?
- Which variables have the least influence on the target ?
- How many qualitative and quantitative variables are there ? How would you transform these values into numerical values ?
- Percentage of missing values per column ?

##### Step 3 : Data Interpretation

After analyzing your data, it's finally time to interpret your results. You have to communicate your analysis using simple words and a table or graph, then use the results to decide on your best course of action.

Example of questions you should be able to answer to:

*NB: This is a non-exhaustive list. Try to make a maximum of interpretations of the dataset.
**Bonus points from yours truly for creative and outside the box questions that you answer.***

You **must** be able to answer :

- Are there any outliers? If yes, which ones and why?
- Which variables would you delete and why ?
- In your opinion, which 5 variables are the most important and why?
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the most expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Belgium? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Wallonia? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)
- What are the less expensive municipalities in Flanders? (Average price, median price, price per square meter)

##### Bonus

- In your opinion, which model of machine learning could solve the task of predicting the sales?

## Deliverables

As a deliverable, we expected a nicely generated presentation that you will present to your peers.
Your code should be clean, structured and documented as always.
